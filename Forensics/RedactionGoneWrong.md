## Description

Now you DONâ€™T see me.
This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/264/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

Hints: How can you be sure of the redaction?

## Solution

Download the report and open it up. <br>
As you can see one of the the blacked out text has the flag that we need. <br>
Highlight the blacked out text and copy and paste it into a notepad.<br>
Eventually one of them is the flag. <br>
