## Description 

We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?
The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:49917/).

## Solution

Open up inspect element and you'll see that the image is located in secret/assets/DX1KYM.jpg. 
Add /secret/ to the end of the original url, press enter and you'll find yourself looking at a gif.
Once again in inspect element open up the <head> element and a href with the folder hidden/ is there.
Add hidden/ to the end of the url you are currently on and press enter.
In the new page open up the <head> element once again and superhidden/ is a new directory
Add superhidden/ to your current url and press enter.
Finally in inspect element and you'll see the flag under the <body> element.
