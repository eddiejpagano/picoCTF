## Description

Can you get the flag?
[Here's](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55827/) the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths.
Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

Hint: none

## Solution

In the search box type ../../../../../flag.txt and it will show you the flag.
