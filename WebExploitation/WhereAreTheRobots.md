Hints: What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution

Open up the website. <br>
As you know robots are disallowed parts of the website. <br>
You can view robots by typing /robots.txt/ to the end of the url. <br>
Once you see the robots for the website there is only 1 url disallowed. <br>
Add the disallowed section to the back of original url and press enter. <br>
Once on the page the flag is right there. <br>
